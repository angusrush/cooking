\subsection{When should I salt?}
\label{ssc:when_salt}

Many recipes involving, say, sweating down vegetables, call for salt to be added in the early stages of a recipe. This is not because one wants to begin seasoning the food early for some reason, but because salt draws water out of the cells of vegetables via osmosis.

Osmosis is exemplified by the following process: two containers of water are separated by a membrane which allows water to pass through, and salt is added to one of the containers. If the membrane does not allow salt to pass through, then water will be drawn out of the container without salt into the container with salt with some pressure, known as \emph{osmotic pressure.}

In the case of cooking, the two containers are the inside and outside of a cell, and the membrane is the cell wall. Salting vegetables in the pan causes an osmotic pressure gradient across the cell wall, drawing water out of the cells and into the pan.

But what causes this osmotic pressure gradient? The short answer is that adding a solute to one of the containers increases the chemical potential in that container; it is then energetically favorable to to equalize the chemical potentials by diluting the container containing solute. However, this is not very intuitive for those who, like the author, lack a deep understanding of thermodynamics, and who want an elementary (or at least intuitive) explanation. Many elementary incorrect or partially correct explanations exist in the literature. For a review of this, see \cite{whatisosmosis}. A more complete derivation, starting from Newton's laws, is given in \hyperref[ch:the_virial_theorem]{Appendix~\ref*{ch:the_virial_theorem}}. The main source is \cite{physicsofosmoticpressure}.

There is a secondary effect of the addition of solutes such as salt or sugar to water: the boiling point of the water increases. This is of great importance in applications such as candy-making, where having great control over the temperature of sugar solutions becomes essential. This is due to a change in

\subsection{Harshness in alliums}
\label{ssc:harshness_in_alliums}

Plants in the genus \emph{allium,} such as onion, garlic, scallions, shallots, chives, etc., take sulferous compounds out of the earth and use them to create what Harold McGee calls \emph{ammunition compounds.} When the cell walls are broken, corresponding enzymes convert these ammunition compounds into harsh-tasting

contain an enzyme called \emph{alliinase.} When the cell walls of these plants are broken, this enzyme reacts with

Acid slows the reaction rate of alliinase into allicin. There appears to be conflicting information about whether allicin is itself responsible for the harsh-taste in garlic, or whether this comes from sulfur-containing compounds that the allicin decays into.


\chapter{Salad}
\section{Caesar salad dressing}

      \item White wine vinegar, to taste

      \item 1 tsp Dijon mustard (optional)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{multicols}
\end{ingredients}
\begin{directions}
  $\,$
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Add lemon juice to a mortar and pestle. Add garlic and a pinch of salt, and mash to a paste.\footnote{We mash the garlic in an acidic environment because of REF.} Add anchovies and mash, then add Worcestershire sauce. Set aside

    \item Make a mayonnaise out of the egg yolk and olive oil, then whisk in the mixture from step 1. Season with salt, pepper, dijon mustard, and white wine vinegar to taste.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{directions}

\section{Tuna and thyme salad}
\label{sec:tuna_and_thyme_salad}

This makes enough salad for my lunch. Having said that, I eat quite a lot. The dressing is inspired by niçoise.

\begin{ingredients}
  $\,$
  \begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item 1 medium clove garlic

      \item 1 anchovy

      \item Leaves from few sprigs of fresh thyme

      \item 1 small shallot, finely minced

      \item $1\frac{1}{2}$ Tbsp white wine vinegar

      \item 1 tsp Dijon mustard

      \item $\frac{1}{2}$ cup EVOO

      \item $1/2$ head lettuce, cut into salad-sized pieces, rinsed, and dried, together with some (optional) spinach.\footnote{A mixture really is preferable here, but either one works.}

      \item $1/2$ can tuna

      \item A few leaves of basil, approx. 8
    \end{itemize}
  \end{multicols}
\end{ingredients}
\begin{directions}
  $\,$
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Add white wine vinegar to a mortar and pestle. Add garlic and a pinch of salt, and mash until the big pieces are broken down. Add anchovy and mash until a homogeneous consistency is reached.

    \item Transfer to a large bowl along shallot, thyme, and dijon mustard. Emulsify in EVOO. Salt and pepper to taste. Add lettuce, and toss to coat. Add tuna, break up as much as is desired, add basil, and gently toss to combine.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{directions}

\section{White bean and tuna salad}
From \cite{seriouseatswhitebeansalad}
\begin{ingredients}
  $\,$
  \begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $1/2$ red onion, cut into $1/8$-inch thick slices

      \item 1 Tbsb white wine vinegar plus extra for drizzling

      \item 2 cans cooked white beans

      \item 1 can tuna or however much you want

      \item 1 clove garlic

      \item 1 tsp Dijon mustard

      \item $1/4$ cup EVOO

      \item $1/4$ cup finely chopped parsley
    \end{itemize}
  \end{multicols}
\end{ingredients}
\begin{directions}
  $\,$
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item In a small bowl, soak red onion in cold water and agitate them, being careful not to break them. Let them sit for about 15 minutes, then drain water. Add vinegar and $1/4$ tsp salt and toss to coat. Set aside for 5 minutes.

    \item Combine beans and tuna in large bowl. Once the onions have marinated for 5 minutes, gently squeeze then dry and add to large bowl. Keep onion-vinegar-salt liquid in the smaller bowl.

    \item To the smaller bowl, add garlic,\footnote{Ideally, one should microplane the garlic directly into the acidic liquid already in the bowl.  Whatever the chemistry, getting raw garlic into a low-pH environment as quickly as possible after the cell walls are broken hinders the production of the compounds that make the harsh, raw tastes. An even better way is to mash the garlic in a mortar and pestle with the vinegar, but then one has to dirty a mortar and pestle.}

    \item Add wine, reduce by about $\frac{3}{4}$. Then add tomatoes and bring to a bare simmer. Add parsley and tuna, and season with salt.

    \item Add pasta to boiling water with a pinch of salt. Cook until just shy of al dente, then strain and add to sauce. Finish the pasta in the sauce for about a minute over medium-low heat; if the sauce is too dry to allow good mixing, add pasta water.

    \item Serve, garnishing with more parsley, and EVOO\@.

\section{Spaghetti with meatballs (sauce)}
Makes a me-sized serving. In progress.
\begin{note}
  For good canned tomatoes like San Marzanos, we want the raw taste, so less simmering time is needed; alternatively, one can reserve some of the can and add it at the end. The tomatoes I usually make this with cost 37 cents per can, and a good long simmer cooks out the unpleasant, metallic taste they have.
\end{note}
\begin{ingredients}
  $\,$
  \begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item 1 Tbsp EVOO

      \item $\frac{1}{2}$ medium onion, very finely chopped

      \item $\frac{1}{2}$ tsp red chili flakes

      \item 2 medium cloves garlic

      \item 1--2 anchovy fillets

      \item 1 Tbsp tomato paste

      \item 1 can whole peeled tomatoes, crushed\footnote{Canned crushed tomatoes are complicated. Cheap crushed tomatoes are often preserved with firming agents in order to keep the clumps of tomato intact, which isn't what we want here. However, good brands can actually be better than whole tomatoes, as they can be picked riper since they don't have to hold together in the can.}

      \item 1 tsp dried basil

      \item 1 tsp dried oregano

      \item 1--2 meatballs from \hyperref[sec:meatballs_a_la_kurt]{Recipe~\ref*{sec:meatballs_a_la_kurt}}.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{multicols}
\end{ingredients}
\begin{directions}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Saut\'{e} onion on medium low heat with around 2 tsp of salt until onion is golden-yellow and thoroughly softened.\footnote{Optionally, a small pinch of baking soda is helpful here. Too much onion ruins the texture of the sauce, in my opinion, so we want to sauté it until it loses most of its texture; baking soda hastens the Maillard reaction as well as softening the onion.} Add garlic and chile flakes and saut\'{e} for about 1 additional minute until the raw smell is gone, add anchovy and cook for an additional minute until it has mostly disintegrated. Add tomatoes, basil and oregano and season with salt and pepper. Add meatballs if frozen and bring to a bare for 10--20 minutes, depending on the canned tomatoes, and at least until the meatballs are warmed through.

Add damp basil leaves and crush until the largest pieces of basil leaf are of order millimeters across. Add parmesan and combine, then add olive oil and blend until emulsified.

    \item To serve with pasta, \emph{do not} finish in sauce. Cook pasta and remove to mixing bowl, then add pesto and combine, adding a splash of pasta water if necessary to fully coat. As the mixed pasta sits the pasta will absorb moisture, leading to a dryer mixture.

\label{ch:baking}

\section{Basic sourdough}
\label{sec:basic_sourdough}

At the moment, my go-to recipe (in baker's percentages) is:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 100\% flour. I've been using 550, the internet suggests a 2:1 mixture of 550 and 1050.

  \item 70\% water

  \item 2.2\% salt
\end{itemize}

The bowl I ferment in is a hemisphere whose radius is 14 centimeters. When fermenting, the dough should roughly double or triple in volume. That means that for a given starting height, the two columns give the estimated lower and upper bounds for the end of fermentation.

\begin{centering}

  \begin{tabular}{ccc}
    Starting height, cm & End height (double), cm & End height (triple), cm \\
    \midrule
    1 & 1.4 & 1.7 \\
    2 & 2.9 & 3.6 \\
    3 & 4.3 & 5.4 \\
    4 & 5.8 & 7.2 \\
    5 & 7.3 & 9.2 \\
    6 & 8.8 & 11.2 \\
    7 & 10.4 & 13.4 \\
    8 & 12.1 \\
    9 & 13.6
  \end{tabular}

\end{centering}

Assuming that wet, unfermented dough has the density $1.26$g/cm$^{3}$,\footnote{Taken from \url{https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/files/20826300/POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS.PDF}} the starting height of 500g of flour and 350g of water should be around $4.1$cm, and the starting height of 1kg of flour and 700g of water should be around $6.0$cm. Thus:

\begin{itemize}
  \item For a \textbf{single boule}, the initial fermentation should end up around \textbf{just under halfway up the bowl} (the 2- and 3-fold marks are 5.9 and 7.4 cm up the bowl), and

  \item For \textbf{two boules}, the initial fermentation should end up \textbf{a little bit under three quarters of the way up the bowl} (the 2- and 3-fold marks are 8.8cm and 11.2cm up the bowl, and $3/4$ of the way up the bowl is 10.5cm).
\end{itemize}


\begin{appendices}
  \chapter{Osmosis and the virial theorem}
  \label{ch:the_virial_theorem}

  In this appendix we derive the standard equation relating osmosis pressure to the concentration of solutes. This derivation comes, mutatis mutandis, from \cite{whatisosmosis}.

  We consider a system of $N$ particles moving inside a box of volume $V$ with position vectors $x_{i} \in \R^{3}$ and momentum vectors $p_{i} \in \R^{3}$. Consider the quantity
  \begin{equation*}
    Q = \sum_{i} x_{i} \cdot p_{i},
  \end{equation*}
  known as the \emph{virial.}
  The time derivative of this quantity is
  \begin{align}
    \tder{Q}{t} &= \sum_{i} \dot{x}_{i} \cdot p_{i} + \sum_{i} x_{i} \cdot \dot{p}_{i} \\
    \label{eq:derivative_of_virial}
    &= 2 T + \sum_{i} \dot{x}_{i} \cdot F_{i},
  \end{align}
  where $T$ is the total kinetic energy of the system, and $F_{i}$ is the net force on the $i$th particle.

  The particles are confined to some finite volume, so there exists some $L \in \R$ such that $\abs{x_{i}} < L$. If we make the reasonable simplifying assumption that the norms of the momenta of the particles are also bounded above by some constant $P$, then the virial is bounded above by some real number $Q_{\mathrm{max}} = NLP$; this is certainly a reasonable assumption if our particles are the molecules in a container of water sitting on a table. Then the time average of the time derivative of the virial at very large times is
  \begin{align}
    \lim_{\tau \to \infty} \left|\left\langle \tder{Q}{t} \right\rangle_{\tau}\right| &= \lim_{\tau \to \infty} \left| \frac{1}{\tau} \int_{0}^{\infty} \tder{Q}{t} \, \d \tau\right| \\
    &= \lim_{\tau \to \infty} \left| \frac{Q(\tau) - Q(0)}{\tau} \right| \\
    &\leq \lim_{\tau \to \infty} \frac{2Q_{\mathrm{max}}}{\tau} \\
    \label{eq:time_average_vanishes}
    &= 0.
  \end{align}

  Taking the time average of \hyperref[eq:derivative_of_virial]{Equation~\ref*{eq:derivative_of_virial}} and using  yields the \emph{virial theorem:}
  \begin{theorem}[virial theorem]
    For a system of $N$ particles whose positions $x_{i}$ and momenta $p_{i}$ are bounded, at large times $\tau \gg 0$ we have the asymptotic relation
    \begin{equation}
      \label{eq:virial_theorem}
      0 = 2\langle T \rangle_{\tau} + \left\langle \sum_{i} \dot{x}_{i} \cdot F_{i}\right\rangle_{\tau}.
    \end{equation}
  \end{theorem}
\end{appendices}

We continue our analysis by noting that the force $F_{i}$ has two contributions: one from the particles' interactions with the walls of our box, and one from their interactions with each other. We write
\begin{equation*}
  F_{i} = F_{i}^{\mathrm{wall}} + F_{i}^{\mathrm{particle}}.
\end{equation*}
The first term is, in the continuum limit, responsible for the macroscopic pressure of our liquid on the walls of the container; the second is responsible for the internal dynamics of the liquid. Plugging this decomposition into \hyperref[eq:virial_theorem]{Equation~\ref*{eq:virial_theorem}} yields
\begin{equation*}
  -2\langle T \rangle_{\tau} = \left\langle \sum_{i} \dot{x}_{i} \cdot F_{i}^{\mathrm{wall}} \right\rangle + \left\langle \sum_{i} \dot{x}_{i} \cdot F_{i}^{\mathrm{particle}} \right\rangle
\end{equation*}
We now take the continuum limit of the first term. The force is zero except when the particles are at the wall of the box, and on the wall of the box it is proportional
