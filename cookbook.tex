\chapter{Pasta}
Some general tips.
\begin{tip}\label{tip:starchypastawater}
  When you boil pasta, don't throw away the water. It's full of starch, and a great way to make oil-based or oil-heavy sauces cling to pasta when boiled down a bit.
\end{tip}

\section{Pasta con le sarde}

  \end{enumerate}
\end{directions}

    \item Heat olive oil in large stainless steel skillet until barely smoking, then add squash. Season with salt and pepper. Cook until well-browned and squash is tender, about 10 minutes.\footnote{In the original recipe, it says this should ony take 5 minutes. This leaves the squash in cubes.
